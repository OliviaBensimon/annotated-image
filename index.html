      <p> My first memories of New York City are of the water-taxis and tugboats going up and down the East River. The rule was, if you’re up before 8 a.m.: don’t wake up the parents. So my brother and I, up at dawn because of jetlag, would sneak out
        of our room and huddle by the window that looked out to the river. I remember being captivated by the wide yellow boats, wondering if you could hail them like you’d hail a cab on the street. Today, when I look out that same window, I can’t
        help but notice how many buildings are going up across the river in Long Island City and Hunter’s Point, and further down in Brooklyn. </p>
      <p> These days, I have been asking my grandparents a lot about what they remember the city looking like when they were young. My grandmother said she remembers driving up the FDR Drive after picking up her father and grandfather from the watch
        factory in the Lower East Side – it was the fastest way home to the Bronx. At the time, she said Midtown Manhattan wasn’t all the skyscrapers we see now. Along the FDR, the city was clearing the old slaughterhouses and derelict tenement
        buildings for the UN headquarters.

            <h3>United Nations Headquarters</h3>
            <p> Designed by a team of international architects, led by Le Corbusier, Oscar Niemeyer, and Wallace Harrison. The site used to be slaughterhouses, the 17 acre plot of land was &quot;donated&quot; by John D. Rockefeller in 1946. Opened in
              1950. </p>

            <h3>The city's evolving skyline</h3>
            <p>There’s been a surge in luxury high rises over the past couple of years. All around Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens, buildings are popping up all around – and the waterfront is prime real estate, with the best views of the city’s famed
              skyscrapers. As my grandmother says, &quot;I’ll blink and they’ll build another.&quot;</p>

            <h3>Old buildings</h3>
            <p>My grandmother has this picture from 1931 hanging by the window in her den – it’s the view from a similar vantage point of their apartment. I recognize the buildings in front, the art deco skyscraper off to the corner, the curve of the
              southern tip of Manhattan island. The piers are gone, replaced by the FDR drive; skyscrapers taking the place of tenement buildings and slaughterhouses. </p>

            <h3>The FDR Drive</h3>
            <p> The most scenic limited-access parkway, maybe ever! Nine and half miles along the East River – from the Battery Park Underpass to the RFK Bridge. In the 1920s, a group of urban planners and civic leaders started thinking of ways to
              make the New York region more accessible and a better place to live. So, Robert Moses, of course, took the reins in the 1930s and designed the original East River Drive that stretched along the Lower East Side. </p>

            <h3>The East River</h3>
            <p>Actually, the East River is a tidal estuary that connects New York Bay to the Long Island Sound. It’s the biggest thing you need to know, and a great fun fact to pull out at parties. Another great fun fact – it was formed some 11,000
              years ago as a drowned valley, at the end of the last glacial period. My earliest memories of the city are of the tug boats and water taxis flowing up and down the river, the tide changing as the day goes by… </p>

      <p> By 7 a.m., my grandfather was usually awake, and would join me and my brother at our spot next to the window. “The East River is not a river, it’s a tidal estuary,” I remember him telling us. He said if we’d look out long enough, we’d see
        the current change, the boats heading up the river towards Hunts Point and Port Morris in the Bronx would be struggling against the current traveling south. </p>
